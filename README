This is a free facebook webscrapy made with python using the selenium automated software

Before we begin first download the chromedriver for this link https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Then you need to install selenium using pip, pipenv or with conda

```python
  pip install selenium *thats pip
  pipenv install selenium *thats pipenv
  conda install selenium *thats anaconda
```

Then input your info into the credential.py file and run the facebook.py script

Actually when the facebook friends page opens and you see a popup close it in other for the automated software to locate the element, allow the script to do its job and look into the terminal for the results
